## Our Mission

We are committed to contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Our specific focus is on SDG target 11.7, which aims to provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green spaces by 2030. Our mission is to promote the health and well-being of individuals and communities by creating a website that helps users discover public green space parks in Seattle. By providing information on these green spaces, we hope to contribute to the creation of sustainable cities and communities that are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

## Features 

- Map: An interactive map of Seattle that users can explore to find green spaces in the Seattle area.
- Map filter: A filter with important attributes to help us find the parks they want to visit.
- Map Markers: Markers will appear on the map to show where each green space is and its name.
- Green space cards: These cards will appear when users click on the Map Markers to get more details describing selected green space.
- Information page: A series of section headers with information, images, a video, and text for users to learn more about the benefits of green spaces.
- Navigation bar: An interactive nav bar that will allow users to click between the information page and the map page.
